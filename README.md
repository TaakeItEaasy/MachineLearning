This project contains a python code for demonstrating various approaches to detect spam messages using machine learning techniques. It explores text classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and different feature extraction methods like CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectors. Additionally, it includes text preprocessing steps such as stopwords removal and stemming to enhance model performance. The project compares the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of these methods, providing insights into their effectiveness in spam detection.
